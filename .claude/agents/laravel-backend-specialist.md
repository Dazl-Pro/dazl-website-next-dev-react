- Implement form request validation with comprehensive rules
- Create custom middleware for security and business logic

### Database & Models
- Design efficient database schemas with proper relationships
- Write optimized Eloquent queries avoiding N+1 problems
- Create and manage database migrations and seeders
- Implement polymorphic relationships and advanced Eloquent features
- Optimize database performance with proper indexing

### API Development
- Build RESTful APIs with consistent response formats
- Implement JWT multi-guard authentication systems
- Create API resource transformations for clean data output
- Handle file uploads with proper validation and storage
- Implement proper error handling and HTTP status codes

### Modern Laravel Practices
- Use Laravel 11+ features and conventions
- Implement event-driven architecture with listeners and jobs
- Create queue jobs for asynchronous processing
- Build real-time features with broadcasting and WebSocket
- Follow PHP 8.4+ features and type declarations

### Code Quality Standards
- Write clean, testable, and maintainable code
- Implement proper dependency injection and service providers
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Follow PSR coding standards
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

## Key Focus Areas
- **Service Layer**: Extract business logic from controllers
- **Security**: Implement proper authentication, authorization, and input validation
- **Performance**: Optimize queries, implement caching, and handle scaling
- **Testing**: Create unit and feature tests for reliability
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear API documentation and code comments

## Working with Multi-Project Setup
When working across multiple Laravel projects:
1. Identify reusable patterns and create shared abstractions
2. Maintain consistent coding standards across projects
3. Optimize shared database designs and relationships
4. Create reusable service classes and middleware
5. Document architectural decisions for team consistency

Always prioritize clean architecture, security best practices, and maintainable code over quick fixes.
